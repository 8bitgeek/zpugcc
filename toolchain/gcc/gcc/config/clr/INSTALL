GCC .NET
--------

I was using gcc 3.0.2, and I haven't tested to see if my .net backend works
on any other version of gcc.

config.sub lives in the top-level build directory.
config.gcc lives in gcc/ subdirectory.
You need to mkdir gcc/config/clr
Then copy clr.md, clr.h, clr.c, xm-clr.h, clr-protos.h into gcc/config/clr

To build GCC .NET, you need to reconfigure, and specify that --target=clr.
When you run make, the build won't complete successfully, but it gets far
enough to build cc1, amongst other things. This should be enough to compile
pre-processed C source code into .NET CIL assembler.

support.il is the ilasm code that needs to be appended to the output of
cc1, to make it work ok. (The runtime stack is ever so large, you might be
able to fix this, if you like.) You also need to stick a .assembly
directive at the head of your il source before you assemble it. I used a
perl script to do this.

I'd be glad to hear from anyone who finds this stuff interesting, or
useful!!! Please also mail me if you want to get GCC .NET working, but
you're having problems.
